Java Data Types
Java data types are divided into two main categories:

1. Primitive Data Types
These are built-in data types. Java has 8 primitive types:

Type	Size	Example	Description
byte	1 byte	byte a = 10;	Small integers (–128 to 127)
short	2 bytes	short s = 200;	Larger integers (–32,768 to 32,767)
int	4 bytes	int x = 50000;	Default integer type
long	8 bytes	long num = 100000L;	Very large integers
float	4 bytes	float f = 3.14f;	Decimal numbers (less precision)
double	8 bytes	double d = 99.999;	Decimal numbers (more precision)
char	2 bytes	char c = 'A';	Single character
boolean	1 bit	boolean flag = true;	true/false values

2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
These are created by the programmer and stored as references.

Type	Example	Description
String	String name = "John";	Sequence of characters
Arrays	int[] arr = {1,2,3};	Collection of same-type elements
Classes	class Student {}	Blueprint for objects
Interfaces	interface Animal {}	Abstract behavior
Enums	enum Color {RED, BLUE}	Predefined constants
📌 Special Notes

int is the default data type for integers.
double is the default data type for decimals.
long values must end with L (e.g., 10L).
float values must end with f (e.g., 3.14f).
char uses Unicode, so it supports all international characters.
